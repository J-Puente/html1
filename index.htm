		<h3 style="color:#042200">Name Origin</h3>
		<p>	     The mountain range recieved its current official name in the late 1700's. According to the National Park Service website:</p>
			<blockquote cite="https://www.nps.gov/mora/learn/historyculture/mount-rainier-history.htm">

				"The mountain captivated early European and American visitors. Captain George Vancouver of the British Royal Navy observed the mountain while surveying the Pacific coast in 1792 and decided to name [it] after his friend, Rear Admiral Peter Rainier."
			</blockquote>
		<p>Although, while most people are familiar with this name many locals and natives of the area  still call the mountain by it's previous name <i>Tahoma</i> or <i>Tacoma</i>, meaning "mother of waters". It is believed the members of the Payallup tribe gave the mountain this name referencing the glaciated peak and streams. The website also mentions there have been archeological discoveries that predate human interation on the mountain as far back as 9,000 years! </p>

		  Mt. Rainier is a stratovolcano located in the Cascade Range of the Pacific Northwest and just 60 miles south-southeast of Seattle. It is the largest mountain in the state with an elevation of 14,411 ft.. Although, Mt. Rainier's most astonishing quality is that it also has <b> a high probability of eruption </b>making it also one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world.

Mt Rainier poses such a threat that it has been added as one of 16 Decade Volcanoes. Meaning, scientist believe that if the volcano was to erupt it would cause significant loss of life and property. While it has mostly remained dormant for thounsands of years the volcano is slowly being weakened by hydrothermal activitiy. Studies of the area also suggest that as many as 150,000 people are living on land with deposits from the last eruption. The next eruption is expected to be significatly greater than the last and thus the results would be catastrophic.</p>
